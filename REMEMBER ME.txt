Dear Diary

Today was a good day. Though school was not that fun, and we did alot of work. Other than my frieds and all my family died.
It was a pretty decent day, I got some stuff done. Now satan is my friend, and I got some sacrifices without doing dirty
work. So even though the world is literally falling apart, I will still survive with my new friend Satan, the devil.

Also I got my first period today, yay. I might be a boy, and it may have been made with a knife... but it still counts.
